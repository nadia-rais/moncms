msgid "You're running in dev mode (FONTAWESOME_ENV === 'development'), but we got an error trying to wp_remote_get the admin UI's asset manifest. That usually means you haven't started up the webpack dev server for admin. Make sure that's running. You can start it under the 'admin/' dir with 'yarn start'."
msgstr "這個網站正在開發模式 (FONTAWESOME_ENV === 'development') 中執行，但外掛使用 wp_remote_get 函式要求管理後台介面項目資訊清單時發生錯誤。這通常代表這個網站並未為管理後台啟動 Webpack 開發伺服器。請確認已啟用相關伺服器，這項操作可在 admin 目錄下執行 yarn start 完成。"
